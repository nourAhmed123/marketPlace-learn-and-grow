    <p><i>Remember a time when you used to learn the alphabet out of a textbook? Do you see kids these days doing the same? Or do you find a rhyme or poem playing on loop on a smartphone or tablet in their hands? While this is one of the more, short sighted ways in which technology has impacted our lives, until a few years back, it was hard to imagine how it would come to alter the way in which we learn something new. For example, it seems like only yesterday, when we used to learn about floppy disks in our school textbooks. Embracing the power of technology and the internet, we have a wagon full of options that depict how we are surrounded by numerous options when it comes to interactive learning. Video lectures, online chat groups, satellite classes, pre-recorded digital lessons are some of the ways in which learning has been digitised today. Owing to the digitisation of learning process through the power of technology and internet, students can take classes and lectures at their time of convenience and from any geographical location that suits them. The modern learning methodologies have been successful in overcoming some of the major shortcomings of traditional learning methods, such as face to face availability, uniqueness of each lecture, attendance, higher cost of face to face availability, shortcoming of reaching a wider audience, and lack of consistency. Technology continues to achieve its advantage over conventional modes of learning because it utilizes digital resources and infrastructure, which is not only easy to use, but is also widely available..</i>
